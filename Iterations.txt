Iteration 1:

Put some data in a few collections, add a Schema using mongoose, display it on a page in a stylish way. Associate the data with a user.

Values: name, description, title, role, technologies, completion_date, recruitment_end_date, technologies

We have two problems: The database is unwilling or unable to recieve the data properly, and the body is always empty in the request (an issue for Postman?)

The other problem is that even if the request is successful, it just ends up loading endlessly and pointlessly. Why?
